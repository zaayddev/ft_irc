RFC 1459              Internet Relay Chat Protocol              May 1993

The recommended order for a client to register is as follows:

           1. Pass message 
                Cases of error :
                    // {461 PASS :Not enough parameters} [ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS] 
                    // {462 :You may not reregister} [ERR_ALREADYREGISTRED]
           2. Nick message
                [ <hopcount> ] If supplied by a client, it must be ignored.
           3. User message
                not included until irc is working into server to server
